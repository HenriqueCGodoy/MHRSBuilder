<h1> Armor set builder for Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (Master Rank only). </h1>

<i>This tool is in development, the next steps are build the SQL database and a interface to interact and build the armor sets.</i>

<p>
In Monster Hunter Rise and its Sunbreak expansion, each armor piece provides base defense, elemental resistances, and most importantly, armor skills—passive bonuses that significantly influence a player’s playstyle and performance. Players can mix and match armor pieces from different sets to create customized sets that maximize offensive and defensive capabilities based on their weapon choice and strategy. However, with hundreds of armor pieces, decorations (gems), talismans, and skill synergies to consider, building an optimized set manually can be extremely time-consuming and complex.

This tool was developed as a personal educational project to enhance my programming skills and deepen my understanding of data handling and software design. It focuses on building a functional application using Python, with libraries such as Pandas for managing large datasets and BeautifulSoup for web scraping data from online wikis via HTML and CSS parsing.
In addition to the current implementation, I also designed a SQL-based database schema to be integrated in future updates, aiming to improve scalability and performance.
